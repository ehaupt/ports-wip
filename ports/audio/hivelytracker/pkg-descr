Hively Tracker is a tracker program based upon the AHX format created in the mid
'90s by Dexter and Pink of Abyss. The format was relatively popular, and many
songs were created and used in scene productions and games. AHX was designed to
create a very SID-like sound on the Amiga. HivelyTracker can import and export
modules and instruments in the AHX format, but it also improves on AHX in
several ways and therefore has its own instrument and module formats.
